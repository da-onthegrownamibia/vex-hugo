In 2018, one of our founders moved from Namibia to graduate high school at the United World College in Changshu China. Her experience of a robust and immersive quality education at UWC planted the seed for a lifelong, relentless belief in the power of ideation and innovation. She partnered up with another young person who was eager to create a platform for young Namibians to charge innovation both in discourse and in practice. In this way, On the Grow was born. In 2021, after securing initial support, we held our first focus seminar with 30 young Namibians eager to be a part of driving national and global change. Selected from a pool of 170 applicants, our first cohort engaged industry experts in the fields of leadership, public speaking, opportunity identification, network building and interview skills. 

Our programming is designed with young people in mind and we are incredibly excited to continue to build on our gains to inspire courageous, disruptive innovation.
